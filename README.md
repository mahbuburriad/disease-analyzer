    • It might have happened so many times that you or someone yours need doctors help immediately, but they are not available due to some reason. 
    • The Health Prediction application is an end user support and online consultation project. 
    • Here we propose an android application that allows users to get instant guidance on their health issues through an intelligent health care application online.
    • The application is fed with various symptoms and the disease/illness associated with those systems. 
    • The application allows user to share their symptoms and issues. 
    • It then processes user’s symptoms to check for various illness that could be associated with it. 
    • Here we use some intelligent data mining techniques to guess the most accurate illness that could be associated with patient’s symptoms. 
    • If the application is not able to provide suitable results, it urges users to go for blood test, x-ray, CITI scan or whichever report it feels user’s symptoms are associated with, so next time user may be able to login and upload an image of those reports. 
    • The application also has a doctor login, these uploaded images are now sent to respective doctor along with patient contact details. 
    • The doctors may now contact the patient for further process.
